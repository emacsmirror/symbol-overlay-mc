*  Symbol overlay multiple cursors (symbol-overlay-mc)

=symbol-overlay-mc= is a tiny Emacs package enabling multiple cursors on symbol overlays. It was born out of a small itch I wanted to scratch. Wrote how I went about it [[https://lmno.lol/alvaro/its-all-up-for-grabs-and-it-compounds][here]]. The package lived in [[https://github.com/xenodium/dotsies/][my config]] until [[https://github.com/mavit][Peter Oliver]] kindly [[https://github.com/melpa/melpa/pull/9267][volunteered]] to bring to [[https://melpa.org/#/symbol-overlay-mc][MELPA]].

** Setup

A sample config, using =M-a= as a key binding:

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package symbol-overlay-mc
    :ensure t
    :bind (("M-a" . symbol-overlay-mc-mark-all)))
#+end_src
